* Openswan v2.6.51 and strongSwan default proposals are incompatible.
  To successfully interoperate with strongSwan, it is advised to
  explicitly define the protocols to use; which includes IKE version
  IKE protocols, and ESP/AH protocols.

  A working example:

  OpenSWAN
  ---------
  conn os-ss
    ikev2=insist
    ike=aes128-md5;modp2048
    phase2alg=aes256-sha1
    pfs=no

  strongSwan
  ---------
  conn os-ss
    keyexchange=ikev2
    ike=aes128-md5-modp2048
    esp=aes256-sha1

  Tested protocols:
  * ikev1 and ikev2
  * ipv4, NAT-T, ipv6
  * encryption: aes128, aes256
  * integrity: md5, sha1
  * DH-group: modp2048

* There is an interoperability issue between Openswan and strongSwan
  when pfs=yes

  In the case of pfs=yes configuration, a DH-group must be negotiated
  for the child/ESP SA. The latest version of pluto (2.6.52) may fail to
  correctly negotiate the DH group for child SA.

  It is advised to explicitly disable PFS (pfs=no) or use the same
  DH group for both ike= and phase2alg= statements.

* Openswan v2.6.51+ may not interoperate with earlier versions.  While fixes
  made in v2.6.51 adhere to the RFCs more closely, they lead to interop issues
  with previous releases.  When interoperating with v2.6.50, or older, consider:

  * using pfs=yes
  * use a smaller ikelifetime= and keylife= on the newer version
    NOTE: this is not advised if the newer version is behind NATT

* Openswan v2.6.52 changes the behaviour of IKEv2 rekeys initiated by the
  original responder of the IKE SA.  That is to say, if the host that did not
  initiate the connection later attempts to rekey the child SA, things may
  break between older (pre v2.6.52) and latter (v2.6.52+) versions of Openswan.

  This change makes Openswan interoperate with strongSwan.  With the change
  Openswan will adhere to the RFCs more closely, and like strongSwan, will
  use message id of 0 for the first request message sent from either side
  of the connection.

  A new conn variable was added for ipsec.conf which allows for backwards
  compatibility with Openswan 2.6.51 and prior.  Setting firstmsgid=1 will
  allow for seamless interoperability with older versions.  The variable
  defaults to 0, which breaks backwards compatibility, but is RFC complaint.
