  <listitem>
<para> Specifies the algorithms that will be offered/accepted for a phase2
negotiation. If not specified, a secure set of defaults will be used. Sets
are separated using comma's.
</para>
<para>The default values are the same as for ike=
Note also that not all ciphers available to the kernel (eg through CryptoAPI)
are necessarilly supported here.</para>
<para> The format for ESP is cipher-integ followed by an optional PFSgroup.
The PFSgroup may be separated by a semicolon, or a dash as with ike=
</para>
<para>For RFC-5114 DH groups, use the "dh" keyword, eg "aes256-sha1;dh23"
</para>
<para> The AH algorithms could be specified with this setting, but AH is not in well supported.
</para>
<para>A special case is AES CCM, which uses the syntax of "phase2alg=aes_ccm_a-152-null"</para>
<para>A special case is phase2=sha2_256-96 which does not mean 96 bits, but means truncating the
sha2_256 hash to 96 bit. </para>
