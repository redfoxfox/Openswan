This test case starts pluto, and then uses addconn to insert a conn
into pluto.  Pluto is then terminated.

This test case uses a certificate to hold the public and private key.
The conn loaded will be oriented only on the basis of the availability
of the private key.

This test is then repeated with LIBNSS turned on, and the certificate and
private key loaded from nss.
